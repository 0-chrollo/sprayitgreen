                <h2>About Sprayit Green</h2>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were confined to their homes during lockdown, Alon Rathbone identified a significant problem: people were psychologically depressed by the sight of dead grass that their children and pets had to play on during winter months and periods of low rainfall.</p>
                    <p>This concern led to the development of a revolutionary product that would be 100% organic, completely safe for humans and animals, dry relatively quickly, and provide a lasting environmentally lush green lawn appearance to combat these depressing environments during winter and drought periods.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h3>100% Organic & Safe</h3>
                    <p>Our water-based formula causes no damage to lawns whatsoever - when natural growth occurs after artificial spraying, the next mowing will give the artificially sprayed grass a "haircut," allowing the natural green color to return.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Problem We Solve</h2>
                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>Garden and maintenance contractors face significant challenges during winter months when lawns become stagnant and dormant. This seasonal downturn often results in staff layoffs, potentially losing valuable employees permanently, while contractors forfeit their monthly incomes due to dormant grass conditions.</p>
                    <p>The psychological impact on homeowners looking at dead, brown lawns creates a market demand for solutions. Our product creates a "keeping up with the Joneses" effect - when sprayed next to a dead lawn, the difference is like chalk and cheese. This systemic demand in neighborhoods helps contractors maintain and grow their client base year-round.</p>

                    <p>Sprayit Green is perfect for individuals already operating successful lawn mowing or estate management services. We don't propose that garden services rebrand their current business, but rather add value through our second division concept.</p>
